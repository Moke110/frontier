"""The knowledge-base gate for the daily push (ADR 0009 §6, #87).

The Console keeps running when the knowledge base is not initialized, but the
daily push must not silently pretend it can run: the push is *explicitly*
blocked and both the terminal and ``/frontier-status`` say "待初始化知识库" with
the next step.  The gate is derived, never duplicated:

- a **completed** ``/frontier-update-kb`` review confirmation (the record #90
  writes into ``<runtime>/update-kb/review/confirmation.json``) releases the
  gate automatically, so finishing the knowledge base needs no extra bookkeeping;
- ``console.state.knowledge_ready`` is the explicit decision recorded by
  ``/frontier-init``: ``False`` for "暂不初始化知识库" (the gate stays closed
  until #90's review really completes), ``True`` for a confirmed knowledge base;
- with no explicit decision and no confirmation the gate stays open, so an
  install that was already pushing before the Console is not blocked merely by
  upgrading; the legacy ``intents`` knowledge gate still applies to the actual
  daily run.

Every refusal carries the same ``knowledge_not_ready`` reason string the legacy
daily gate uses, so the console, the status snapshot and #90's receipt speak one
language.
