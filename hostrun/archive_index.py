"""The archive index: a code-directory ledger of the material files.

ADR 0009 keeps the archive directory free of ledgers.  The index therefore lives
in the code directory runtime area and records, for every material file under
``originals/`` and ``pushes/``, its business id, size and content md5.  It is
append-only in effect: re-registering the same bytes is a no-op, so
``/frontier-update-kb`` can ask "which files are new?" without re-reading a
directory twice.

Nothing here writes into the archive directory and nothing touches Feishu.
