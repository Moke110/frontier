"""One resolution of the two top-level locations: code directory and archive.

ADR 0009 retired the single data root in two:

- the **code directory** holds the checkout, the private environment,
  configuration, run state, queue, proposals, logs, the executor lease, console
  state, installation records, initialization state and the private lark-cli;
- the **archive directory** holds only ``originals/`` (source documents) and
  ``pushes/`` (push artifacts).

Runtime state always lives in ``<code>/.frontier`` and the archive location is
the one last resolved for that code directory (``<code>/.frontier/layout.json``),
so no command or module derives a location on its own.  The legacy ``--home``
flag and its "data root" are gone: passing it is refused with a migration
pointer instead of silently mapping one old tree onto the new model.

Nothing here starts a process or reaches a network.  ``ensure`` is the only
function that creates directories, and it never writes a file.
