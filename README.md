**A research knowledge base that reads papers for you and reports back in Feishu.**

frontier turns the themes you care about into knowledge cards, retrieves the papers that
match them, has an agent rank and write a daily report, and delivers it to your Feishu.
You rate the report and confirm knowledge updates; every accepted update makes the cards,
claims and evidence sharper. The result is a research memory that grows from your own
judgement instead of a firehose of links.

## What it does

- **Retrieval grounded in your cards** — each report starts from the knowledge cards you
  confirmed, not from a generic feed, so the searched queries stay on your topic.
- **Agent-written reports** — one bounded run ranks candidates, writes one report and
  renders it with figures, then delivers it as a Feishu file message.
- **Human confirmation, not silent edits** — the agent only proposes knowledge updates.
  You score the report, accept or reject each update, and only accepted proposals are
  written back to the authoritative Feishu Base.
- **Nothing resident on your machine** — frontier registers no Windows service, no
  scheduled task, no registry key and no PATH entry. A single foreground console window
  is the service; close it and everything stops.

## How it works

```

Knowledge itself lives in Feishu: the Base tables hold the cards, claims and evidence, and
Drive folders hold the originals and delivered reports. The copy on your machine is
rebuildable. The archive directory keeps only `originals/` and `pushes/`; configuration,
queues, logs, leases and install records live under the code directory, in
`<code>\.frontier\`.

## Installation

Frontier includes its own Pi-based Agent. You need Windows 10/11 x64, a model API key,
and a Feishu account authorized to create and use the required app, Base and Drive resources.
The distribution includes Node.js, Pi, the Feishu CLI and the Python business runtime.
No separate DSH or Pi installation is needed.

Extract a Frontier distribution into a writable directory and open PowerShell there:

```powershell
.\bin\frontier.cmd console install
.\bin\frontier-console.cmd
```

Run `/frontier-init`: choose an archive folder, enter your model provider, model name and API key,
then complete Feishu authorization, resource setup and daily push time. For an OpenAI-compatible
service, also enter its API base URL. Model/provider names must match your service.
The key is stored locally in `.frontier/agent/model.json`; protect this file. Installation reports
and process arguments do not include it.

Configuration, queues and logs live in `.frontier/`. The separate archive contains `originals/`
and `pushes/`. Interrupted setup resumes. Existing DSH installations must complete the new
model configuration step. No external host skill registration is required.

Use `install package --from <zip> --digest <digest.json>` for verified package upgrades,
`install verify` to check files, and `install rollback` to restore a retained version.
Upgrades preserve `.frontier/` and the archive.

## Using frontier

Use the console or Feishu:

- **Console** (always the primary surface): the foreground window shows scheduled runs,
  Feishu messages and card clicks, agent-run summaries and errors; the input line at the
  bottom takes the commands below.
- **Feishu direct message** while the console is open: send one of the six phrases below.

| Console command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/frontier-init` | first-run setup; also resumes an interrupted setup |
| `/frontier-start` | start the service again after a pause |
| `/frontier-stop` | pause pushes and Feishu replies; the console stays open |
| `/frontier-status` | current state, last run, last failure |
| `/frontier-push` | request one more report now |
| `/frontier-update-kb` | incremental knowledge-base initialization with per-item review |
| `/frontier-logs` | recent console and agent-run logs |
| `/frontier-help` | command help |
| `/exit` | stop the console (and with it the whole service) |

| Feishu direct message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `推一篇` | push one report now |
| `处理反馈` | process submitted feedback |
| `状态` | current status |
| `暂停` | pause the service |
| `恢复` | resume the service |
| `测试飞书消息` | send a test message to yourself |

Only your own direct messages are accepted; groups and other people are ignored. While the
service is paused, only `恢复` gets through and every other message is answered with a pause
notice. Two commands need arguments — changing the push time and changing the archive
directory — so frontier first runs a read-only intent check, and only a confirmation card
you click executes the change.

Each report arrives with a feedback entry point. Rate it first, then confirm each knowledge
update question one by one; an edited answer only takes effect after you explicitly submit
it. Unanswered questions block the next push, but they do not block storage maintenance.

The console keeps time itself: one push per day at your chosen time (default 08:00), with a
single catch-up run if a day was missed. Feedback is polled every five minutes, and every
ten minutes frontier pulls text edits and "under review" flags from the Base back into the
local copy of truth. It stays quiet when nothing changed.

### Initializing or extending the knowledge base

`/frontier-update-kb` pauses the formal service, asks you for a folder, has the agent read
everything in shards, and prints each candidate card and claim for review: press Enter to
accept, Backspace to discard, Tab to keep it marked `Under review`. Cards and claims carrying
that marker are not retrieved or written about until you clear "under review" in the Feishu
Base. Progress is incremental: a second run reads only files the archive has not registered
yet.

## Pausing, moving to another machine and recovering

`/frontier-stop` (or `暂停` in Feishu) pauses scheduled pushes and Feishu replies while the
console stays open; `/frontier-start` (or `恢复`) resumes. Closing the console window stops
the whole service and nothing responds in Feishu until you open it again. When you reopen it,
frontier restores the previous state: paused stays paused, running starts the service again.

To move to another machine or host, stop the console on the old machine first, then run the
installation on the new one and choose to connect to the existing Feishu knowledge base; the
agent takes over and restores from there. Only one executor may use a knowledge base at a
time.

The local copy is rebuildable, but an offline archive can be the only remaining copy of a
paper that was removed from Drive — keep it. Uninstalling the runtime configuration never
deletes Feishu data, and deleting cloud originals always needs a separate confirmation after
a verified offline backup.

## Troubleshooting

- **The console exits right after starting** — usually missing write permissions or a damaged
  runtime. Relaunch the launcher with full permissions, or inspect the
  conclusions of `install report` and `install verify`.
- **Feishu commands do nothing** — the console must be open. Closing the window stops all
  Feishu responses; queued feedback is processed after the next start.
- **The queue does not move** — check that answers were explicitly submitted and that there
  is no older unanswered question blocking the next push.
- **A push failed** — `/frontier-status` shows the last failure and the number of attempts.
  frontier does not retry automatically: fix the cause, then request a new push.
- **"Running" does not mean delivered** — a scheduled run that produced no delivery evidence
  is reported as such. Trust the delivery result, not the timer.

## Development (source install)

Use Python 3.13 and Node.js >=22.19.0. From the repository root:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt pytest
npm --prefix agent ci --ignore-scripts
npm --prefix agent run build
node agent/node_modules/@larksuite/cli/scripts/install.js
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m hostrun.cli console install
.\bin\frontier-console.cmd
```

The TypeScript agent uses the Pi SDK and explicit tools to call existing Python business modules.
Python retains validation, storage and PDF processing. Check the agent with
`node agent/dist/main.js --check`; run regression tests with `python -X utf8 -m pytest -q`.
Release builds require the compiled agent and both bundled runtimes.

## Desktop interface

In this source checkout, double-click `Frontier.cmd` to open the native desktop window. It requires Python with Tkinter and `pythonw.exe` (the development `.venv` supports this). The embedded distribution Python does not currently bundle Tkinter; packaged GUI delivery is not yet supported.

Use the center pane to chat with the built-in Agent, the left pane to switch locally saved conversations, and the collapsible right pane for Console commands and interactive answers. Model settings mask the API key. Ctrl+Enter sends a message; Stop cancels the current Agent process. Conversation history is stored locally under `.frontier/desktop/`. CLI arguments to `Frontier.cmd` retain their original behavior.
